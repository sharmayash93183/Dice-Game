# Dice-game
This dice game is a simple web-based game for two players where each player rolls a die. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic, the game generates random dice images for each player. The player with the higher roll wins, and the result is displayed after clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
